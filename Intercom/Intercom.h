 seen a specific user before - that user will be created automatically in Intercom when the session begins.

 state changes for you, so you won't need to explicitly start and stop a session. 
 Start on login and end on logout - we'll do the rest.

 @note Calling `beginSessionForUser...` every time at app launch might interfere with processing
 push notifications in the SDK: `beginSessionForUser...` will wipe out the existing persisted
 session information but processing of push notifications will only work if there is a session.
 Therefore we recommend beginning a session only once - when the user authenticates.

 Events are how you can submit user activity to Intercom. Once you are sending Intercom event data, you can
 filter your user base with those events and create Auto Messages to send whenever an event occurs. Every
 event is associated with an event name, the time it happened, the user that caused the event, and
 optionally some extra metadata. Events record the count, first and last occurrence of an event.
 
 Events are different to Custom Attributes in that events are information on what Users did and when they
 did it, whereas Custom Attributes represent the User’s current state as seen in their profile. For example,
 the first time they subscribed to a paid plan, or the most recent time they changed their plan would be
 represented by events, whereas a User Attribute would be used to record their current plan.
 
 Because Events are used for filtering and messaging, and event names are used directly in Intercom by
 your App's Admins we recommend sending high-level activity about your users that you would like to message
 on, rather than raw clickstream or user interface actions. For example an order action is a good candidate
